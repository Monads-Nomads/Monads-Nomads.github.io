The following is based on a transcript of chat with ChatGPT to understand OnlyFans' legal position, pretty interesting stuff.

💬: is OnlyFans mostly for edgy content like porn? 

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

OnlyFans is *best known* for adult or sexually explicit content because many creators use the platform to share such material and earn money directly from fans. This aspect of the site receives the most media and cultural attention. 

However, OnlyFans was not designed exclusively for pornography—it’s open to creators from many fields, including fitness instructors, musicians, writers, and artists. There are non-adult creators who use it to monetize their content or give special access to fans.

**Summary:**  
- Sexually explicit or adult content is very common and is the main reason for OnlyFans' fame.
- The platform allows but does *not require* adult content; other topics are also permitted.
- If you’re considering using or exploring the platform as a creator or subscriber, you'll find both adult and non-adult content—but the former is far more visible and prevalent.

If you’d like statistics or want to know about alternative platforms, let me know!


💬:well, there's always a market for porn, I wonder why this is the only platform for that

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

You're absolutely right—there’s always been a strong market for pornography online. OnlyFans isn’t the *only* platform that serves this market, but it became the *most prominent* because:

- **Mainstream sites (like Instagram, Patreon, and YouTube) prohibit adult content.** Most payment processors and advertisers avoid adult material, so “ordinary” platforms usually ban it.
- **OnlyFans allowed and made adult content easy to monetize.** It gave creators an easy-to-use platform with subscription payments, where they could control content and pricing, and crucially, keep a direct relationship with fans.
- **Few competitors handled both payment and compliance effectively.** Payment processors are strict about adult content, making this hard technically and financially for startups.
- **Timing and media attention mattered.** OnlyFans grew quickly, especially when other sites (like Patreon and Tumblr) shut down adult content, and during COVID-19 when many turned to online side-income.

There *are* other platforms for NSFW content (like Fansly or JustFor.fans), but OnlyFans became "the" brand with mass recognition and a huge base of creators and fans.

If you want examples of competitors or want to know about how payment and legality shape these markets, just ask!


💬: what's wrong with porn, seems free speech, this can't be illegal? 

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

Pornography (between consenting adults) is *not* illegal in most Western countries; it’s generally protected as free speech, with important exceptions:

- **Illegal types of porn:** Child pornography, non-consensual recordings, or material considered "obscene" by local standards (which can vary by country and even city) are *not* protected and are illegal.
- **Free speech applies:** In the US, the First Amendment gives strong—but not unlimited—protections for adult, consensual porn.
- **Why the bans then?**  
    - **Moral & business reasons:** Banks, Visa, Mastercard, and ad companies often *refuse* to serve adult content. Without payment processors, most platforms can’t make money from NSFW content, so they ban it—even if it’s legal.
    - **Legal complexity:** The risk of accidentally hosting illegal content—especially with minors or revenge porn—is high. Sites often avoid porn to sidestep costly lawsuits or criminal liability.

So, porn isn’t generally illegal, and it *is* a free speech issue, but business, legal risk, and public relations make it very difficult for major platforms to support it openly.

💬: so why's OF OK with payment processors

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]   

OnlyFans is able to work with major payment processors (like Visa and Mastercard) because:

- **Strict compliance:** They enforce rules to prevent underage content, non-consensual material, or anything illegal. They use age verification, content review teams, and respond quickly to reports of policy breaches.
- **Lower-risk business model:** OnlyFans uses a subscription-pay model tied to user identity (credit/debit card), which is seen as less risky than platforms with anonymous uploads.
- **Cooperation with processors:** OnlyFans works closely with financial partners, updating systems regularly to meet their requirements and standards for vetting both creators and users.
- **Scale and oversight:** As a large, high-profile company, OF invests in teams and technology to proactively avoid legal and PR crises—which keeps payment processors (mostly) comfortable.
- **Reputation management:** In August 2021, OnlyFans announced it would ban explicit content due to pressure from financial providers, but reversed course after demonstrating to payment companies that their risk and moderation procedures were strong enough.

In summary: **OnlyFans is “okay” with payment firms because it’s tightly regulated (internally), works proactively to avoid violations, helps processors manage legal/PR risk, and follows changing industry standards quickly.**

Let me know if you’re interested in how this compares to other platforms, or more about how this risk management actually works!


💬: what's legal definition of obscene

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

### U.S. Legal Definition of "Obscene" (The Miller Test)

The Supreme Court’s *Miller v. California* (1973) set the current test. Material is legally obscene if:

1. **The average person**, applying contemporary **community standards**, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest (i.e., it’s designed to sexually arouse in a way judged inappropriate by most people locally).
2. The work **depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way**, sexual conduct specifically defined by law.
3. The work, taken as a whole, **lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value**.

If all three points are met, the material is legally "obscene"—and *not* protected by the First Amendment in the U.S.

#### Key Points
- “Community standards” means what is considered acceptable varies by place and time.
- “Patently offensive” is judged under law, not just personal taste.
- Anything with serious value—literature, art, science, political critique—does *not* count as obscene, even if X-rated.

If you want the definition in another country or examples of what’s *actually* counted as obscene in court, let me know!


💬: hmm, how can porn pass those three tests though, like prurient interest, offensive's in the eyes of beholders and not sure it can be viewed as having literary, artistic etc. values.

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

You’re right—the Miller test is difficult to apply, and most pornography *does* appeal to prurient interests, might seem offensive to some, and rarely claims much “serious value.”

However, for something to be legally obscene in the United States, **all three parts of the Miller test must be satisfied, at the *same time*.** Here’s how typical porn escapes this label:

- **Community standards vary:** What’s “patently offensive” in one place may be normal in another, making courts hesitant to set a broad standard for what’s “offensive enough.” Juries and judges are often reluctant to call adult-consensual porn deeply offensive by today’s major-city norms.
- **Serious value is interpreted broadly:** Courts can—and often do—find any “artistic,” “literary,” or “scientific” element in even basic porn (for example: arguments that it explores human sexuality, educates, or has some cultural intent). In practice, unless the material is extremely graphic *and* totally lacking any redeeming feature, it does not meet this test.
- **Actual obscenity prosecutions are rare:** Most classic porn (magazines, websites, videos involving consenting adults) isn’t prosecuted, and adult pornography is widely distributed with limited legal trouble.

So: **Legal porn is not considered “obscene”—only the most extreme, graphic, and intentionally offensive material (with zero redeeming value) ever gets that label in American courts.** The test is meant to safeguard free speech, erring on the side of allowing even “tasteless” material unless it’s egregious.

If you’re curious about any specific court cases or other countries’ standards, just let me know!


💬: OK, so only very weird porn's not covered. 

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

You’re essentially correct!  
Mainstream, consensual adult porn is *almost never* legally considered “obscene” in the U.S., even if it’s unusual or controversial.

#### What actually gets classified as legally obscene?
- Porn with **extreme violence**, **humiliation**, or material catering to particularly graphic or depraved interests, **and** with absolutely zero artistic, literary, political, or scientific value, might cross the line—but that is rare and hard to prove in court.
- **Child pornography, non-consensual content, or sexual depictions of animals (“bestiality”)** are always illegal—these don’t fall under obscenity law but are banned under separate statutes.

#### Most “weird” or extreme adult porn:
- Still isn’t usually prosecuted unless it deals with one of the always-illegal categories above.
- Offensiveness alone is *not* enough; it has to be judged truly exceptional in depravity or lack of any redeeming value, which rarely happens today.

**Summary:**  
- The legal bar for “obscene” porn is very high; most “weird” but consensual adult porn is not illegal in the U.S.
- If you’re wondering about specific types or want to know about situations where porn has been prosecuted, let me know!


💬: how does OnlyFans handle discovery, does ads network having issues for promoting it? 

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

### Discovery on OnlyFans
- **No public feed or algorithm:** OnlyFans does *not* have a TikTok/Instagram-style discovery feed, "explore" page, or search by interests. There's limited ability for strangers to “find” you on the platform itself.
- **Intentional privacy:** This is by design, to control underage access and keep the platform from making porn "easily" discoverable, which lowers legal/business risks.
- **Driven by creator self-promotion:** Creators get subscribers by promoting *themselves* elsewhere—Twitter/X, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok (if allowed), or their own websites, then linking to their OnlyFans page.
- **Referral features:** Some cross-promotion occurs when creators recommend each other, and OnlyFans runs an affiliate program, but this is modest compared to "discovery" on mainstream social media.

### Advertising/Ad Networks
- **Major ad networks (Google, Facebook/Meta, etc.) ban adult service ads:** OnlyFans itself and most creators *cannot run traditional ads* for NSFW content on mainstream ad networks.
- **Mainstream media is cautious:** Most TV, radio, or online affiliates won't accept explicit OnlyFans ads due to their adult reputation, even if non-adult content is promoted.
- **Direct and niche promotion:** Some non-mainstream, adult-friendly networks or sites allow OF ads; otherwise, OF and creators rely on content marketing, collabs, and organic reach on less restrictive social platforms (Twitter/X, Reddit, some smaller platforms).

---

**In summary:**  
- **Discovery is limited and privacy-minded**—most traffic comes from creators’ own outside marketing, not inside OnlyFans.
- **Mainstream advertising for OnlyFans is blocked/restricted** by nearly all major ad networks due to their policies on adult content, forcing reliance on organic and niche outreach.

If you want more specifics about ways creators promote themselves—or examples of what happens when ad networks reject adult brands—just ask!


💬: ah, that's also why the creators befriend each other if they are in similar trade? I don't take they actually socialize?

🤖:[ChatGPT4.1]

Yes, the lack of mainstream discovery options pushes OnlyFans creators to **collaborate and support each other**—primarily as a business strategy:

- **Cross-promotion is key.** Creators with similar audiences often “shout out” or tag one another in posts on Twitter/X, Reddit, etc. This exposes both to new fans who are likely interested in similar content.
- **Collabs drive growth.** Sometimes creators team up for joint content (co-shoots, videos, photosets, livestreams). Each one gains followers from the other’s fanbase—a win-win for both.
- **Mutual support networks develop:** Many creators use dedicated group chats, Discord servers, or subreddits to share tips, security info, and marketing tactics.

Are they “real friends”? Sometimes!
- **For many creators, the connection is mostly business-focused.** Trust and cooperation are necessary for successful collab content and promo exchanges.
- **Friendships can develop** from frequent collaboration, as with any job where coworkers become actual friends.
- **Not all are close:** Just like influencers on other social media, creators sometimes work together mainly for strategic reasons with minimal real-life socializing.

**Summary:**  
- Most befriending among OnlyFans creators **begins as business collaboration**—a survival tactic given promotion limits. Over time, some creators become real friends, but networking is primarily about mutual growth in a tough marketing environment.
